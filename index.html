            <h2>Why Choose Me?</h2>
            <p>Psychology: My Passion, My Purpose!<br>
            Psychology isnâ€™t just a subject to meâ€”itâ€™s my passion, my purpose, and my absolute favorite thing to talk about! From understanding human behavior to exploring the depths of the mind, psychology is an exciting journey, and I love bringing that excitement into everything I do.<br><br>
            As an Assistant Psychologist, Iâ€™ve had the incredible opportunity to work with people facing mental health challenges, including Autism Spectrum Condition, PTSD, and anxiety disorders. Supporting individuals in their personal growth has reinforced just how powerful psychology is when applied in real-world settings. Whether itâ€™s using evidence-based interventions or helping clients navigate their emotions, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how psychology can transform lives.<br><br>
            On the research side, I thrive on diving into data, uncovering insights, and making sense of human behavior through analysis. Working as a Research Assistant has taught me the importance of grounding practice in scienceâ€”whether itâ€™s analyzing mental well-being data or applying psychological assessments to measure mental health outcomes. Research isnâ€™t just about numbers; itâ€™s about understanding people and constantly evolving our knowledge of the mind.<br><br>
            Now, as a psychology tutor, I bring my love for both clinical practice and research to my students. My goal is to make learning psychology fun, interactive, and meaningfulâ€”whether itâ€™s acing exams, mastering research methods, or applying theories to real life. I want to inspire my students to see psychology not just as a subject, but as a fascinating exploration of what makes us human!</p>
